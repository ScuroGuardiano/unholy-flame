   * I don't even know how to describe this.
   * It got me like 2-3 hours to get it right.
   *
   * I had 2 problems with ColumnMode.force and ScrollbarH=true
   *
   * One problem was that resizing columns was terribly bugged when you tried to resize column.
   * Like only click on resizing bar was enough to move everything a lot.
   * I solved that problem by setting ColumnMode.standard on table and writing my own evenly resizing algorithm
   * Which you can see in timeout callback
   *
   * Seconds problem was that if I went to other route eg. /home and went backs to table route, let's say /tags
   * the table wasn't sized properly. It's content was exactly 17px too large. And what's funny my own resizing algorithm
   * had the same bug! What I found is that on view init _innerWidth of table was wrong, it was... 17px too large.
   * But what's more funny is that when I console.dir-ed this.table it has correct size. Totally non-sense.
   * Then I discovered that expanded object console.dir is rendering at the next event loop iteration. So at ngAfterViewInit()
   * it has wrong property _innerWidth but at the very next event loop execution it has correct innerWidth.
   * That's why here is this setTimeout(() => ..., 0);\
   *
   * And one more thing. I am setting visibility:hidden at first call [bypassing ts-check coz ofc element.style is readonly for him xD]
   * and then I set it back to visible, coz there was a column size jump at render. It wasn't sexy.
   *
   * I hope that makes this clear to future me and maybe some folks who somehow found this project.
   * It has to be called on ngAfterViewInit and window resize I guess.
